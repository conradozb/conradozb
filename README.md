- 👋 Hi, I’m @conradozb
- 👀 I am very happy to have found my IKIGAI in Data Analysis,  Machine Learning and Data Science disciplines.
- 🌱 Almost every day (Monday-Sunday all day long) since January 2022 I have been working with Python and ML. So I'm guessing I've had at least 2500 hours of self guidance and learning. My most recent work is about MLFlow with Scikit-Learn.
- 💞️ Although there is much more to learn, I believe I am ready for a good start for a first job into this disciplines. 
- 📫 How to reach me at conzarbad@gmail.com
