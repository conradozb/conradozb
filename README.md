- 👋 Hi, I’m @conradozb
- 👀 I am very happy to have found my IKIGAI in Data Science, machine learning and data analysis.
- 🌱 Almost every day since January 2022 I have been working with Python. I'm guessing I've had at least 2500 hours on it. My most recent fraud prediction project is a sign of my progress.
- 💞️ Although there is much more to learn, I am very excited for a first job in this discipline in which I believe I am ready for a good start. 
- 📫 How to reach me at conzarbad@gmail.com
